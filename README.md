### Hi there! I'm Ethan

## ✨ About Me
I'm studying CS at UW Seattle 📖 (+ abroad at EPFL ✈️)

From coding games in Scratch to building scalable systems at Amazon, I enjoy the never-ending novelties computer science brings! I'm interested in machine learning applications, particularly computer vision, and databases. Currently dreaming about building a badminton match analysis application🏸👀
